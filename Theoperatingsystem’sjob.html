The operating system’s job: 
When you buy a new computer the operating system already be loaded.
It’s up to you to use the operating system which is loaded on your computer or upgraded one. The three most common operating systems for personal computers are Microsoft Windows, mac OS, and Linux.
Modern operating systems use a graphical user interface, or GUI (pronounced gooey). A GUI lets you use your mouse to click icons, buttons, and menus, and everything is clearly displayed on the screen using a combination of graphics and text.
Each operating system's GUI looks differently, so if you switch to another operating system it may seem unpopular at the first time. However, modern operating systems are designed to be easy to use, and most of the basic rules are the same.                  
An operating system can also support APIs that make applications is able to utilize OS and hardware functions without the need to know anything about the low-level OS or 
hardware state. As an example, a Windows API can enable a program to obtain input from a keyboard or mouse; create GUI elements, such as dialog windows and buttons; read and write files to a storage device; and more. Applications are almost always tailored to use the operating system on which the application intends to run.
